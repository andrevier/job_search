Regular C++ Software developer
Luxoft 
Associate 
Germany 

Luxoft is one of the major software services companies world-wide. We deliver professional software services in multiple business verticals such as finance, automotive, and digital transformation. Supporting large vehicle manufacturers in the area of development, production and aftersales is Luxoft's ambition.

The software inside a vehicle was traditionally expected to be a very controlled and self-contained environment. Equipping cars with perception and machine intelligence changes a lot in the overall picture of the vehicle manufacturer. LUXOFT's goal is to empower our customers, with deep domain knowledge and smart solutions, to develop cars of the future. Great mechanical engineering is not the only criteria anymore for delivering the best cars in the world. Using state of the art software technologies are key to provide the requested user experience.


For the development of state of the art middleware software components for the future autonomous vehicle generation of a premium German car manufacturer, we are searching for experienced C++ developers to join our international team.


In the context of the development of the next car architecture this automotive SW development project will gain a central role in the client's E/E Architecture.

The subject of this specific project is the development of a software platform for the next generation of the client's autonomous driving system. This includes software engineering and software development activities for platform functionalities and systems functions of the SW Platform.


System Functions in this terms are all open and proprietary functions which are

•necessary for E/E integration into a vehicle: e.g. programming, diagnostics, coding, vehicle clock/time sync management, service discovery, communication via standard links like ethernet etc.

•necessary as a supplemental function: e.g. logging of data to external logger boxes (tracing), debugging capabilities (e.g. via JTAG)

•necessary for internal operation of the system, e.g. process management, CPU/RAM/Flash quota management, scheduling

•necessary for the safe operation (e.g. ASIL requirements, watchdogs, diagnostic monitors)

•necessary for the secure operation (e.g. HSM configuration, secure boot concepts for all relevant SoCs etc.)


The software platform is based on an QNX operating system, which hosts a commercial Adaptive AUTOSAR stack including OEM specific functionalities for

•programming

•diagnostics

•coding

•vehicle clock/time sync management

•service discovery

•logging

•process management, CPU/RAM/Flash quota management, scheduling

•safety and security functionalities like certificate management, HSM configuration, secure boot, etc.


The software stack developed within this project shall be deployable to different underlying hardware platforms. The initial launch of this software stack is currently targeted for July 2025.


Responsibilities
