# Job Search
Repository for my research on open positions in the field of Electrical Engineering and Software Development.
The objective of this research is to get knowledge of the job market such as:

1. What are the necessary skills?
2. Where are the main players in the market?
3. How do these players convey the message in their profiles?
4. How do people in similar job positions behave and convey their message and their brand? Photos, key-words and so on.
5. How to make documents like CVs to propose to these positions?

To answer these questions, the project involves the creation of a database with the jobs' informations like:
- Name of the position
- Enterprise
- City/country
- Assigned level of the position
- Search words
- Key words
- Date
- Link

And tools to process these informations.
